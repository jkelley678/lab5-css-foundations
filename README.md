## Implementation Approach
I decided to begin by separating the page into two columns where I could put  login info in the first column and the text boxes for email and password as well as the sign in button and forget passwrod link in the second. From there, I worked on centering, followed by making the page responsive to viewport size. Then I focused on the coloring and style of the page. All design decisions were to best replicate the replication.png we were given.
